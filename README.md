## System Overview
- Hole spacing 20mm between centers
- Accepts 5mm bolt holes (actual size is 5.6mm. 0.6mm for tolerance)
- 4mm thickness baseplate
- Meant to work with V Slot Bearings commonly found on 3D printers

- basically two 1U plates stuck end to end.

## 1U for 2020 Extrusion
![1U2020](Images/1U2020.png)
- a 1U plate with a mount for 2020 extrusion jutting out normal to the face of the 1U plate.
- Useful for mounting 2020 Extrusion perpendicular to a desk, mounting 2020 extrusion for a gantry.

## 1U for NEMA 17 Stepper Motor
- a 1U plate with holes for a NEMA 17 motor.

## 2U for NEMA 17 Stepper Motor

- basically a 2U Plate but with a NEMA 17 motor mount on one end.

## Offsets
![Offsets](Images/Offsets.png)
- 5mm 6mm and 7mm variants. (6mm and 7mm work well for a V Wheel slider)
- Offsets are useful for separating plates in order to accommodate hardware heads such as socket head or button head bolts. 
- They are also designed to create a linear rail system where the small end of the offset rides on the inner portion of a V Wheel bearing.
